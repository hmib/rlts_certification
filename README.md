# rlts_certification
RLTS_Certification is a module that update the customer's statuses and send email reminders using Magento Cron jobs.   We created custom customer attribute (id: certi_status) of drop down type with INACTIVE, CANDIDATE and CERTIFIED status of customer. When a customer is created, it is INACTIVE. When customer purchases the class, its status changes to CANDIDATE. When a CANDIDATE successfully completed the class and exam, its status changed into CERTIFIED. The CANDIDATE status will be INACTIVE after 6months and CERTIFIED status will be INACTIVE after two years.   In this module, we're sending email reminder to the CERTIFIED customer to renew his/her certification. Also on duration completion. this module will change the status of customer.
